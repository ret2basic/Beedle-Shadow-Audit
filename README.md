# Beedle Shadow Audit

This repo contains the code and my own shadow audit findings of the [Beedle contest](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clkbo1fa20009jr08nyyf9wbx) on CodeHawks.

This activity is inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/i/bookmarks/all?post_id=1786360157338747287). Five actionable steps:

1. First thing is to clone the repo locally and start reading the codebase - just as you would in a real contest.
2. Next after having understood the protocol, invest 1-2 days trying to think of different attack paths.
3. Spend a day compiling a report of all the findings from above - you'll practice how to describe and argument your findings.
4. Consuming the report and learning everything you can from it.
5. You' re gonna spend the next 1 day watching the code-along videos of that same contest.
